Hi TA's,

When grading the homework:
  1) Please use the "FINAL" version as that is where I have formatted everything correctly and have set the row indexes correctly.
     This "FINAL" version basically placed my "DRAFT-TEST" code into the "STARTER" file so that it is easy for you to read.
     However for some reason in GitHub it isn't printing out all of the columns and some of the row indexes' formatting is messed up.
     Thus, please download the file and run it in Jupyter Lab/Notebook.
  2) Absolute worst case scenario, please use the Draft-Test code as the data output is correct, the formatting and indexes are not set though.

Please reach out to me via slack if you have any issues viewing or grading my HW.

Best Regards,
Fez
